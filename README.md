# Prediction_of_coal_indicator
## Using machine learning methods to predict coal indicator-Vdaf
##### Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), I reduce dozens of  secondary features into four key representative features. These are then combined with the original primary features to form an enhanced input for a decision tree model, predicting coal carbon indicators.
